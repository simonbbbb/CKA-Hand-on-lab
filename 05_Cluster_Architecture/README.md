# Cluster Architecture, Installation and Configuration (25%)

This section covers setting up, configuring, and maintaining Kubernetes clusters.

## Key Concepts

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Kubernetes cluster installation and configuration
- kubeadm for cluster management
- Cluster lifecycle management
- High availability control plane setup
- Helm and Kustomize for package management
- Container Network Interface (CNI)
- Container Storage Interface (CSI)
- Container Runtime Interface (CRI)
- Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Operators

## Practice Questions

1. What are the core components of the Kubernetes control plane?
2. Explain the role of etcd in a Kubernetes cluster.
3. How would you set up RBAC to allow a user to only view pods in a specific namespace?
4. What steps are involved in creating a high-availability Kubernetes cluster with kubeadm?
5. How does the Container Network Interface (CNI) work in Kubernetes?
6. What is the purpose of Helm in a Kubernetes environment?
7. Explain the difference between Kustomize and Helm.
8. What are Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and how do they extend Kubernetes?
9. How would you upgrade a Kubernetes cluster with minimal downtime?
10. Explain the concept of operators in Kubernetes.

## Hands-on Tasks

### Task 1: Set Up RBAC

1. Create a new namespace called `development`
2. Create a role that allows creating and viewing pods and deployments in the `development` namespace
3. Create a service account called `dev-user`
4. Bind the role to the service account
5. Verify the access by impersonating the service account

### Task 2: Install a Kubernetes Cluster using kubeadm

1. Prepare three nodes for a Kubernetes cluster
2. Install a container runtime (containerd)
3. Initialize the control plane on the first node
4. Configure networking with a CNI plugin
5. Join worker nodes to the cluster
6. Verify cluster functionality

### Task 3: Configure a Highly Available Control Plane

1. Set up a load balancer for the API server
2. Configure additional control plane nodes
3. Ensure etcd is properly configured for high availability
4. Test failover scenarios

### Task 4: Use Helm and Kustomize

1. Install Helm
2. Deploy an application using a Helm chart
3. Create a basic Kustomize configuration for an application
4. Apply different overlays for different environments

### Task 5: Work with CRDs and Operators

1. Create a simple CustomResourceDefinition
2. Create instances of your custom resource
3. Install an operator (e.g., Prometheus Operator)
4. Use the operator to deploy and manage an application

### Task 6: Manage Cluster Lifecycle

1. Upgrade a Kubernetes cluster from one minor version to the next
2. Back up etcd data
3. Restore etcd from backup
4. Add a new node to the cluster
5. Safely drain and remove a node from the cluster
